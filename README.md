# ML-Project
This is a Machine Learning project on Loan Approval Prediction 

# 1. Abstract-
For my project, I decided to experiment with, design, and implement a loan prediction system. I used a loan prediction dataset to automate the real-time loan eligibility process based on customer details such as education, loan amount, credit history, income, and more. Since the goal was to classify whether a loan would get approved or not, it became a classification problem, falling under Supervised Machine Learning.

The dataset I worked on contained 615 rows and 13 columns. I performed data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering before implementing models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine to evaluate their accuracy. My results showed that the Support Vector Machine model provided the most accurate predictions, indicating its potential usefulness in real-world loan approval scenarios.

# 2. Introduction-
The problem I addressed is as follows: A finance company dealing in home loans receives customer applications which then go through an eligibility validation process. Since this process is time-consuming and tedious, I decided to automate the loan approval process using machine learning.

My focus was to analyze existing customer data and apply machine learning techniques and algorithms to predict which future applicants are likely to be approved for a loan. Approving loans is a critical task for any finance company, as it directly impacts profitability. Approving high-risk applicants can cause financial losses, while rejecting low-risk applicants may result in lost profits. Through this project, I aimed to develop a predictive model that could streamline the loan approval decision-making process and minimize associated risks.

To build this model, I used various attributes from applicant profiles, such as income, credit score, marital status, and occupation. I trained three different machine learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree—to predict whether a given applicant's loan is likely to be approved or denied. This system helps loan officers prioritize and sort applicants at the initial stage, allowing for more efficient evaluations in later stages.
